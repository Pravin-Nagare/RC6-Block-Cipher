# RC6-Block-Cipher
RC6TM is a new block cipher submitted to NIST for consideration as the new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This program implements the RC6-w/r/b, where w = 32, and r = 20 in C. The input of the program is the user key and either plaintext (for encryption) or ciphertext (for decryption).
